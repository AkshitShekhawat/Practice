//so what we have done is
        /*
        We sending a request with LoginRequest in the RequestBody, we authenticate the user, and we
        get the authentication object now if the authentication is successful we have the authentication
        object that is fully populated, if this is not successful then we have exception thrown and are
        directly inside the catch block, and after we are returning.

        If there is no exception then what we do so if the login is successful and there was no exception
        then we need to store the authentication in the security context for that we are going to use
        security context...
